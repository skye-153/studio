## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey intelligence, sophistication, and insights.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to ensure clarity and readability against the dark primary color.
- Accent color: Vibrant Orange (#FF9800) to draw attention to key interactive elements, indicating actionable insights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, known for its modern, machined look which offers a very readable, neutral, and objective user experience.
- Use crisp, geometric icons to align with the modern aesthetic. Ensure icons are easily understandable to aid in navigation.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment. Prioritize clear hierarchy to guide users through complex data sets.
- Use subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., micro-interactions) to provide feedback and enhance the user experience. An example could be a smooth transition between pages or visual cues upon data loading.
